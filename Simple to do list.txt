This code is a simple to-do list program implemented in Python. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Empty list of tasks**: `tasks` is initialized as an empty list. This list will hold dictionaries where each dictionary represents a task.

2. **Display tasks**: The `Dis_task()` function is defined to display the tasks in the to-do list. It iterates through the `tasks` list and prints each task along with its status (done or not done).

3. **Add task**: The `Add_task(task_details)` function is defined to add a new task to the to-do list. It takes a task description as input, creates a dictionary with the task details and a status of `False` indicating it's not completed, and then appends this dictionary to the `tasks` list.

4. **Mark as completed**: The `mark_complete(task_num)` function is defined to mark a task as completed. It takes the task number as input, finds the corresponding task in the `tasks` list, and changes its `completed` status to `True`.

5. **Remove task**: The `Remove_task(task_num)` function is defined to remove a task from the to-do list. It takes the task number as input, removes the corresponding task from the `tasks` list using `pop()`, and prints a confirmation message.

6. **Main program loop**: The main program runs in an infinite loop (`while True`) displaying a menu of options for the user:
   - Display To-Do List
   - Add a task
   - Mark as completed
   - Remove task
   - Quit

   The user can enter a choice, and based on the choice, the respective function is called. If the user chooses to quit (`5`), the loop breaks, and the program ends.

This code provides a basic interactive interface for managing a to-do list.
