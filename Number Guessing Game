This Python code is a simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number between 0 and 100, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `import random`: This imports the `random` module, which is used to generate random numbers.

2. `import time`: This imports the `time` module, which is used to introduce delays in the program.

3. `number = random.randint(0,100)`: This line generates a random integer between 0 and 100 and stores it in the variable `number`.

4. `def User(name):`: This defines a function called `User` which takes a `name` parameter.

5. `print("{0} we are going to play a game. I am thinking a number between 0 to 100.".format(name))`: This line prints a message to the user, including their name, informing them that they are going to play a game where they need to guess a number between 0 and 100.

6. `time.sleep(.8)`: This introduces a delay of 0.8 seconds before printing the next message.

7. `print("Go Ahead. Guess!")`: This prompts the user to make their first guess.

8. `def pick():`: This defines a function called `pick`.

9. `for i in range(1,10):`: This starts a loop that will run for 10 iterations (from 1 to 9). This means the player has 9 guesses to guess the number.

10. `guess = int(input("Guess: "))`: This line prompts the user to input their guess, converts the input to an integer, and stores it in the variable `guess`.

11. The following `if` statements check the user's guess against the randomly generated number and provide feedback accordingly:
    - If the guess is out of range (less than 0 or greater than 100), it prints a message informing the user.
    - If the guess is lower than the generated number, it informs the user that the guess is too low.
    - If the guess is higher than the generated number, it informs the user that the guess is too high.
    - If the guess is equal to the generated number, it congratulates the user for guessing the number and breaks out of the loop.

12. `playagain = "yes"`: Initializes the variable `playagain` with the value "yes" to start the game.

13. The `while` loop:
    - `while playagain=="yes" or playagain=="y" or playagain=="Yes":` This loop runs as long as the user wants to play again (if they input "yes", "y", or "Yes").
    - `name = input("May I ask you for your name.\n")`: Prompts the user to enter their name.
    - `User(name)`: Calls the `User` function with the user's name.
    - `pick()`: Calls the `pick` function to start the guessing game.
    - `playagain = input("Do you want to play again = ")`: Asks the user if they want to play again and stores their response in the `playagain` variable.

This code provides a simple interactive game experience where the user can repeatedly guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.
